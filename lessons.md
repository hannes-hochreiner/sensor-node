# Lessons learned

  * The card edge contacts for the SWD connector (0.05" pitch) work perfectly with the OSH Park 2oz boards
  * An additional pin 1 indicator is required for the MSOP10 and QFP48 footprints in KiCAD as the ones included in the default footprints are not visible on the PCBs
  * The decoupling capacitors are really important
  * It is really nice to be able to debug programs on the chip
