# Wrong pin assignment

As I was getting ready to solder the radio chip (Si4012), I realized that the pin assignment for this chip was wrong.
This is - obviously - not ideal.
While the problem is easily fixable and the financial hit of ordering new boards is bearable (< 15 EUR), the additional delay (3-5 weeks) is quite severe.
However, there are still a few things I can do with the boards as they are now:

  * check that programming the MCU works
  * check the communication with the sensor
  * check that the sensor works with the voltage the battery is able to supply
