# New PCBs arrived!

Big shout-out and thank you to [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) who did everything in his power to deliver the new version of my board as fast as possible!
While I expected that the new PCBs would take 5-6 weeks to arrive, it took little more than 2 weeks.
Really exceptional service.
